## Test performance of hash functions and rehashing algorithms in hash tables
This program tests various hash functions and rehashing algorithms on sample data to see which one is more efficient, faster, and just overall better.  
Run `hash_tests` on your PC to see the results. 
```console
$ hash_tests test-data/antonyms.txt
```

I wrote this program in a way that it is very easy to add a new hash function and test it against the other ones.  
Make sure the hash function (or rehash function) follows the specified function format
